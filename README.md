## What comes next? and other issues...

Moving forward, I'm going to put more emphasis on separating functionality when I can. I am always looking to improve my coding practices, and I feel there is room for improvement within this project - especially regarding class creation.

I'd like to add more shapes and levels of customization in the future as well.

## Installation

Requires Node.js.

Uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest).

Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).
